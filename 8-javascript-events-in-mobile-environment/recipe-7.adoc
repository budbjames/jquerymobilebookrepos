#.# Creating an image gallery with the swipe event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you want to create a photo gallery on a mobile device, there isn't a jquery plugin for this.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Fortunately, you can use jQuery Mobile's events to build your own. The swipe event works well for this. 

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
