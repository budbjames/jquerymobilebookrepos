4.6 How to Use the Filter Search Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lists are a common way to display a lot of information to the user. Unfortunately, when the list gets too long, it become difficult to find the information you need.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
jQuery Mobile makes it really easy to declaratively add filtering to a list. The following markup shows an example using the filter.

<ul data-role="listview" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="Search countries..."> 
  <li><a href="#">Afghanistan</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Iceland</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Japan</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Thailand</a></li>
  <li data-filtertext="USA U.S.A. United States of America"><a href="#">United States</a></li>
</ul>

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this example, we have created a filterable list of countries. Adding the attribute data-filter="true" to the listview tells jQuery Mobile to make it filterable and automatically adds a search bar to your listview. The search bar will have the placeholder "Filter items..." by default but you can override this by specifying your desired text in the data-filter-placeholder attribute. In this example, we tell jQuery Mobile to display "Search countries..." instead of the default text.

By default, the listview filter will search against the content in each list item. However, if you want to filter against different content, you can specify this in the data-filter text attribute. In the example, we added this to the United States list item so that the item will filter against keywords USA, U.S.A and United States of America. Note that when this attribute is added, the contents of the list item are ignored.
