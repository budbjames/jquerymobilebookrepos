4.4  Nested Multipage   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Navigation between pages is one the most important features in the web development arena. When it comes to mobile web development, the design and transition between the pages are even more critical. You need to design nested multiple pages and the navigation between them.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Design of the main page
    
Create a div with the attribute data-role="page" and set the id. To set the content of the page, you need to create another div and add the attribute data-role="content".
    
Then, since our main page is going to be a list of links to the nested pages, we are going to add an unordered list or ul with the data-role="listview".
    
You can also set the list divider theme by adding the attribute data-divider-theme. In our specific case, we are going to set it to "a". 
    
To add a little bit of space between the border and the ul you can also add the data-inset attribute and set it to 
true. Once you do that, the ul will have a little bit of margin.

Now that we have the ul, we need to start adding list items or li with the only attribute data-theme. In our 
specific case, we are going to set it to d. If you want to have a header in your list view, you only need to add the 
attribute data-role="list-divider" and role="heading" to the first li. The next step is to define the content of 
each li. Since we are going to have links to the nested pages, let's add a tags with the attribute data-transition to indicate how the transition between the pages will appear. On the href, we are going to set it to the id of the nested pages. Finally, the content of the page can be anything (i.e., Page1, Page2, etc.).
   
We now have the skeleton of the main page, but we need to define the nested pages.
    
Nested Pages
By now, you should have learned that to define a page, we only need to create a div with data-role=page and set the id. In our case, we define another div, add the data-role attribute and set it to page. Then we set the id attribute. Be aware that to navigate from a link in the main page to a nested page, the href must be the same as the id of the nested page.
   
If you want to navigate back from the nested page to the main page, add another div with the data-role="content" 
inside the nested page and add a "a" tag inside it with the data-role attribute set to button data-transition set 
to fade and href set to the id of the main page.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
