<ul data-role="listview" id="characters" data-theme="c">

<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-theme="d" data-divider-theme="b" data-count-theme="e">
  <li data-role="list-divider">Gmail</li>
  <li>Inbox<span class="ui-li-count">15</span></li>
  <li>Sent<span class="ui-li-count">7</span></li>
  <li>Important<span class="ui-li-count">50</span></li>
</ul>
