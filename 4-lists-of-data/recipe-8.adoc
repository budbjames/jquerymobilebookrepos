5.8 Make a List That Contains Dynamic Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You've seen how easy it is to use jQuery Mobile's List View to make easy to use lists and menus for your web applications, but sometimes you might not want to hardcode all of your list items. You want to make a list using dynamic data.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
So far, we've talked about lists containing static data. Lists can be populated dynamically from an array of data, an AJAX call to a web service or even a local database. You must make sure you have an element on the page to attach the dynamic data to, and then make your call and inject the items into the listview element. This can make it really easy to populate large lists, but keep in mind that the more items you put into your list, the more your application's performance will be affected.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first thing you must do is place a listview element on your page, this is what the dynamic data will be injected into. Make sure you have some way to select the element you plan to use for injection. In our case, we will give our list an ID, which is really easy to select using jQuery.

[source, html]
----
<ul data-role="listview" id="myList"></ul>
----

Once you have got your list element on the page, you will need to get your data in order. For this example, we are using an array of strings, but you can also make an AJAX call to a web service or use local storage data. Our array will look as follows:

[source, javascript]     
----
var arrItems = [
  "Ben Folds Five",
  "Cake",
  "Gomez",
  "Guster"
];
----

Once you have your data set, you need to write some JavaScript to loop over the results and inject them into the list element.This can be done quite easily using jQuery's `.each()` method, and then within that using the `.append()` method to inject the record into the listview. However, the `.append()` method updates the DOM each time it is run, so your app's performance will suffer. What we'll do instead is create an empty array (`newItems`), and then use the `.push()` method to insert each item into that array. Once that is done, you can use join the array items with an empty string delimiter to create a single string with your new items markup, which you can then append to your list. This way, the DOM is manipulated only once. The last step is refresh the listview using `.listview( 'refresh' )`. This is a very important step, because if you omit it, none of the jQuery Mobile formatting will be applied to the injected items. The refresh method will only run on the newly injected nodes, so you will not have to worry about your existing items being affected.

[source, javascript]     
----
$( document ).ready( function() {
  // Set your list element into a variable
  var $myList = $( "#myList" );
  var newItems = [];
  
  // Loop through your results and append a new <li> onto your list for each result
  $.each( arrItems, function( index, value ) {
    newItems.push( "<li><a href='index.html?id=" + index + "'>" + value + "</a></li>" );
  });

  // Append the new items to your list
  $myList.append( newItems.join( "" ) );

  // Refresh the listview to apply jQuery Mobile formatting to new items
  $myList.listview( "refresh" );
});
