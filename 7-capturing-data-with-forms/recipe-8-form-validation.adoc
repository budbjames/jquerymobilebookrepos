#.# Form Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enabling client-side form validation in a typical jQuery Mobile application presents a range of challenges. Firstly, the single page application nature of a typical jQuery Mobile app requires validation rules, specific to a given form page, to be applied during initialization of that page.  Secondly, due to the markup generated by jQuery Mobile during progressive enhancement, error messages must be placed appropriately around enhanced form elements that fail validation; this ensures errors blend in sensibly when viewed with enhanced forms.


Solution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Firstly, to enable client-side form validation, an appropriate validation strategy is required.  Rather than implementing a custom validation approach, a range of elegant frameworks already exist for form validation; one of the most stable and widely used is the jQuery validation framework.  This jQuery plug-in allows validation rules to be specified and easily bound to target form elements in both a declarative and programmatic way.  Validation of elements is performed elegantly, with the framework supporting a range of extension options for custom error placement, together with custom validation rules.

To enable validation of a specific page in our jQuery mobile application, we simply hook an event handler function into the pageinit event.  This handler function fetches the relevant form and binds any validation rules using the jQuery validation plugin.  Validation is now enabled for the form, with submission of an invalid form causing errors to be displayed.  

To render errors correctly within the context of enhanced form elements, a custom error placement function is used which places error messages within the most sensible part of the DOM.  As will be discussed, custom error placement is mainly required for custom select menus and radio button controls.
