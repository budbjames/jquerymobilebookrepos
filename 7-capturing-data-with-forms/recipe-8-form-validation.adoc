#.# Form Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enabling client-side form validation in a typical jQuery Mobile application presents a range of challenges compared to validation in conventional web applications. Firstly, the single page application nature of a typical jQuery Mobile app requires validation rules, specific to a given form page, to be applied during initialization of that page.  Secondly, due to the markup generated by jQuery Mobile during progressive enhancement, error messages must be placed appropriately around enhanced form elements that fail validation; this ensures errors blend in sensibly when viewed with enhanced forms.
