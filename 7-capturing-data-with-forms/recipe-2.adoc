7.2 Creating form elements in jQuery Mobile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Problem
+++++++
Standard HTML form elements were designed for mouse and keyboard interactions. Although browsers on mobile devices attempt to
make the user experience better, the form elements are still not touch-friendly. Certain elements are just too small for fingers.

Solution
++++++++
jQuery Mobile provides a rich set of touch-friendly form elements that are based on native HTML form elements. Using these form elements will provide your user with a better user experience when accessing your website from their mobile devices.

Standard HTML elements like text inputs are enhanced

jQuery Mobile also provides the option to render smaller versions of the form elements. Simply add the *data-mini="true"* attribute
to your form control.

Although jQuery Mobile enhances form elements and buttons to be touch-friendly, you can turn off that option so that standard, native
controls are rendered instead. By adding the *data-role="none"* attribute to any form element, jQuery Mobile will not apply any
enhancements.
