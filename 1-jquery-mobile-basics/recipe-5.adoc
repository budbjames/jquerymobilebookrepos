1.5 What is jQuery?
JavaScript adds behaviour to web pages and make it more interactive and helped in building 
a lot of web applications which behaves similar to desktop applications.
Products like Gmail,Yahoo Mail explored the possibilities of JavaScript and brought 
desktop like experience to users in browsers.

jQuery is not a replacement for JavaScript, but can be considered as a helper library which simplifies JavaScript.
jQuery changed the way JavaScript is written.
As the jQueryâ€™s tag line states, its  all about adding more  behaviour to web pages by writing less.
When web applications became more interactive , cross browser scripting needed extra effort from developers. 
jQuery helped in reducing that effort and made cross browser scripting 
,ie, selecting and manipulating DOM elements, DOM traversal, creating animations, handling events, 
and developing Ajax applications, easy.

jQuery was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. 
jQuery is free, open source software, dual-licensed under the MIT License or the GNU General Public License, Version 2. 

As per wiki, jQuery is used by over 52% of the 10,000 most visited websites and 
is the most popular JavaScript library in use today.

1.Dynamically add a simple span with red background color to a div and that div to body.
using native JavaScript and jQuery. 

Solution
Native JavaScript
         
  var _div = document.createElement("div");
  var _span = document.createElement("span");
  _span.innerHTML = "span contents";
_span.style.backgroundColor = "red";
  _div.appendChild(_span);
  document.body.appendChild(_div);  

jQuery

$("body").append($("<div>")).append($("<span>span contents</span>").css("background", "red"));

Its sure that  native JavaScript programmers initially feels  jQuery syntax too complex, but they will soon feel jQuery 
life easy when compared to coding in native JavaScript and  to worry less about cross browser inconsistencies.

The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
