1.5 jQuery Mobile - WebPages and Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since jQuery Mobile is such a robust cross-platform framework for developing mobile applications, it provides you with many paths to generating and deploying your application. First and foremost is the mobile web application. 

Because jQuery Mobile is created with cross-device mobile browser support as a primary target, it provides an extensive solution for anyone who wishes to target a large variety of mobile devices with one set of code. It is also familiar to web developers, as it is built with standards in mind like HTML5, CSS3 and pragmatically utilizes semantic markup with progressive enhancement as a primary concern. You can utilize jQuery Mobile as the UI backbone for your web application, by adding a few choice media queries, what starts as a mobile first web application can easily become a wonderfully responsive web application. jQuery Mobile is also extensible, just as the core it is built upon - jQuery, it lends itself to allowing developers to roll their own widgets and plugins in order to suit the needs of their particular projects. 

Along with building a web application that supports a wide range of mobile devices out of the box, jQuery Mobile applications are very well suited to become a native cross-platform experience if wrapped inside a native device WebView. This can be done manually across platforms, or through utilization of a third-party framework to build native applications. One of the most highly recognized and widely used frameworks for turning a web application into a native application is Apache Cordova (aka PhoneGap). PhoneGap leverages the power of the WebView native to mobile devices - basically a web browser without and address bar or back button - and allows a developer access to some device specific features such as the Camera, Contact Lists, File system, and much more. Going native takes an already incredibly beautiful and extensive jQuery Mobile application to another level.  We go further into building native applications in Chapter 12 - Going Native with jQuery Mobile.

Whether you as a developer choose to build a web application with jQuery Mobile and leverage its extensive cross-browser, cross-device support to create their solutions, or choose to take that application to the native application world with a platform such as PhoneGap, you will be able to create a rich mobile experience without having to manage multiple projects for divergent platforms. This is the allure of jQuery Mobile.
