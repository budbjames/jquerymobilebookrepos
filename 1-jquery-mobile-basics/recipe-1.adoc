1.1 Who Is This Book For?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By _James Weaver_

This book was written by members of the jQuery and jQuery Mobile community.  Its purpose is to teach other developers in the community how to tackle common tasks while working with jQuery Mobile. 

This book assumes you have a good understanding of how to use jQuery. While you don't need to know jQuery Mobile extensively, it will be beneficial to have an understanding of the basics. However, if you are totally new to jQuery Mobile, don't close the book yet, this chapter will provide you with tasks that provide the building blocks of developing with jQuery Mobile.
