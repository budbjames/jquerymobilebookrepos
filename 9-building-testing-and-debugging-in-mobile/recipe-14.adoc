9.14 Debugging Your IOS App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
+++++++
You have created a remarkable jQuery Mobile application. You have debugged and tested successfully on a desktop browser, but now you must debug on your iOS device which can be more difficult and less intuitive than debugging in a desktop browser.

Solution
++++++++

There several options available to a developer, where you can append a debug script to your jQuery Mobile application, access a remote server that will relay information from and to your mobile device. Some of these projects are wholly web-based, while others may require some local server installation in order to work properly.
