7.2 Using the pageinit() event in place of $(document).ready() and onload.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The typical jQuery Mobile web application is designed to behave as a single page application. Traditionally any page specific javascript code within a multi-page web application is executed when the DOM has finished loading. Since the single page model inevitably means that the DOM is only initialised once, the traditional approach is not sufficient for jQuery Mobile. 

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To overcome this problem, jQuery mobile provides the +pageinit+ event that fires each time a new page is loaded within the application. The application must simply bind a handler function to this event, that will execute the page specific code once the page has been loaded and initialised. 

The following is a simple example demonstrating a handler function bound to the +pageinit+ event. This handler opens an alert box containing the Page Title as soon as jQuery Mobile has finished initialising the page.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Javascript provides the +load+ event which is fired once the DOM and all resources such as images have loaded within a webpage. jQuery improved on this and superceeded this event with the +.ready()+ method that is invoked once the DOM has finished loading, but before all resources have loaded, therefore improving page load times. Neither of these events fit the singlepage architecture of jQuery Mobile because these events generally only fire once during a singlepage application's lifetime. Therefore this section discusses how the new +pageinit+ event provides equivalent functionality to jQuery Mobile applications. 

When you first launch a jQuery mobile application, the initial html document is loaded into the web browser. Within this html document one or more pages are defined using simple semantic html within the DOM. These are defined as div elements with a data-role attribute containing the value 'page'. See the following example:

[source,html]
----
<div data-role="page" id="page1"> 
	<!-- page content -->
</div> 
----

The first page defined in the DOM will be the page that is rendered initialy in the application. As the html document is loaded, this first page is initialsed and then the +pageinit+ event is fired. Subsequent pages are transitioned to via hyperlinks within the application. Page hyperlinks reference pages either by the element id of a page div defined inline in the original html. e.g. #page2, or by a URL to an external resource representing the page. e.g. /page3.html

jQuery Mobile loads these two styles of page link differently. Links to pages defined inline, and therefore already present in the DOM can simply be initialised by enhancing the markup. Links to external resources require an additional step, in which jQuery Mobile fetches the resource using an ajax call and embeds the page into the DOM before enhancing/initialising the page. However, regardless of the link type, once page initialisation is complete the +pageinit+ event is fired. i.e The +pageinit+ event is agnostic to the mechanism used to load a page and is triggered each time a page is initialised.

The following example demonstrates javascript being invoked in response to the +pageinit+ event in all three page loading mechanisms. When navigating the example application Page 1 loads initially through a full page load, Page 2 is loaded inline, and Page 3 is loaded as an external ajax call. 

.Pages 1 and 2 (Inline pages)
[source,html]
----
include::recipe-2-code/example2.html[]
----

.Page 3 (External Resource)
[source,html]
----
include::recipe-2-code/page3.html[]
----

The javascript code that is attached to the +pageinit+ event can subsequently execute page specific code. An example scenario for this would be registering page specific form validation code.

Finally ,it is worth noting that the jQuery documentation recommends the use of the +.on()+  method to register event handlers instead of the older +.bind()+ and +.delegate()+ methods. This recipe uses the +.on()+ method to demonstrate the recommended approach to event handler registration. The code samples bind the handlers to the top level document object, and specify a filter selector that constrains the event to only the page div elements.
