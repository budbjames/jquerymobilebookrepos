#.# Collapsible Content Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I want to display some information in a way that will enable to toggle the view to show or hide, so that it does not take too much space on the screen (especially relevant when the content will be displayed on a small screen).

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use a collapsible content block, using a container with data-role="collapsible". For example: 

        <div data-role="collapsible">
            <h3>Virtual Noticeboard</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>News: </dt>
            	  <dd>I am currently working on my recipes for the jQuery Mobile Cookbook...</dd>
                <br />
                <dd>I will be attending the next jQuery UK Conference and will provide highlights on my blog.</dd>
                <br/>
                <dt>General Information: </dt>
            		<dd>All students are invited to attend the module fair on Wednesday.</dd>
                <br />
                <dd>All level 5 students are invited to the Final Year Project talk in the Large Lecture Theatre on Tuesday 1pm-2pm</dd>
            </dl>
			  </div>

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The collapsible content block will by default have content collapsed, so that only the collapsible heading is visible, next to a + sign, that indicates that the content can be expanded. The user can expand (show) the content of the collapsible by touching anywhere on the heading (text or + sign). The content then appears below the heading in its own content area. The + sign becomes a - sign, indicating that the content can now be collapsed (hidden).
The heading element (<h3>Virtual Noticeboard</h3>) in the example above must be immediately inside the collapsible container. It is this heading that will be displayed and clickable when the collapsible content is collapsed. It is possible to have more than one collapsible on the same page, and there is no restriction to the content of a collapsible.
