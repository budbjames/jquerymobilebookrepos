Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I would like to display a navigation bar that is fixed to the top or bottom of the screen.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Createing a fixed position navigation bar is very simple.  All it takes is to add the data-position attribute and set set it to "fixed".  The same attribute can be added to either the header, footer, or both

<div data-role="header" data-position="fixed">
  <h1>Fixed position header</h1>
</div>

Not all devices support fixed toolbars.  When a device does not support this function the toolbars are fixed to top and bottom of the page content.  The toolbars will then scroll with the content like a standard toolbar.
