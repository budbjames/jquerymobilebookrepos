#.# Collapsible sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You want to use more than one collapsible, but when one collapsible is expanded, you want the others to be collapsed.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use a collapsible set by having your collapsibles inside an additional div container with data-role="collapsible-set": 

[source,html]
<div data-role="collapsible-set">
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-content-theme="c" >
		<h3>Virtual Noticeboard</h3>

Discussion

A collapsible set is a set of collapsibles that work together. All collapsibles in a set may be collapsed at the same time, and only one collapsible in a set can be expanded at any one time. The collapsibles in the set will look like a block of collapsibles, with the top and bottom rounded corners applied to the extremities of the set by default. 

Just as you are able to add theme to the header or the content of the collapsible, you can do the same with the collapsible set, by adding data-theme to the collapsible header, and/or to the collapsible content.
