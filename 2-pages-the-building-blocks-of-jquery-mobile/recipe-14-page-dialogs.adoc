Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You want to display a small page to the user in a way that will not look like or behave like a standard page. Instead, you want this to be more like a dialog box.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Create the page as a standard jQuery Mobile page, and add the data-rel="dialog" attribute to the link to that page: 

[source,html]
TODO: CODE HERE

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Anne's picture here is a link to the page with the +id+ +contact_anne+. +contact_anne+ is the id of a standard jQueryMobile page which is in the same file as the picture which was clicked, which allows the page to be called by simply linking to its +id+ (see chapter xxx for more information on linking pages).

By adding the +data-rel="dialog"+ as an attribute to the link to the +contact_anne+ page +id+, the page will not be displayed in full screen like all standard pages. Instead, it will come as a dialog box floating in the middle of the screen. 

It is possible to add a +data-transition+ optional attribute that will define the transition used to bring the dialog box. By default, the reverse set transition is used to leave the page. In the example above, the transition +"pop"+ was used. 

Note that it is possible to customise the look of the dialog by setting the +data-overlay-theme+ attribute and/or changing or removing the default 10% top margin.
