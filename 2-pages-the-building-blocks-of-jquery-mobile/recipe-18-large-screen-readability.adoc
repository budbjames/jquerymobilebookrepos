#.# How to make pages readable on desktops and other wide screens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Your app looks fine on the phone but not on your desktop monitor. Text lines are too long to read comfortably.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Add one line of css to limit the screen width .

jqpage { max-width: 790px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;}

and give each div with a data-role of page a class of jqpage:

<div id="load" data-role="page" class="jqpage">


Discussion

It is very easy when working with jQueryMobile to concentrate on how your app looks on a small screen. However, some people will use their desktop monitor.

So just use CSS to set the max-width of your app to 790px. Then using a left and right margin of auto, the app will center in the desktop browser regardless of the width.

This avoids the problem of lines of text that are too long for comfortable reading. This is a simple 'readability' usability tip.
