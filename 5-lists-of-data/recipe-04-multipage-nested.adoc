5.4  Nested multipage   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Navigation between pages is one the most important features in the web development arena. When it comes to mobile web development,
the design and transition between the pages are even  more critical. This recipe is aiming to the design of nested multiple pages
and the navigation between them using jQuery Mobile

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Design of the main page.
    
    Create a div with the attribute data-role="page" and set the id 
    To set the content of the page you need to create another div and add the attribute data-role="content"
    
    Then , since our main page is going to be a list of links to the nested pages, we are going to add a unordered list  or ul
    with the data-role="listview".
    
    You can also set the list divider theme by adding the attribute data-divider-theme . In our specific case
    we are going to set it to "a". 
    
    To add a little bit of space between the border and the ul you can also add the data-inset attribute and set it to true.
    Once you do that , the ul is going to have a little bit of margin.

    Now that we have the ul, we need to start adding  list items or li with the only attribute data-theme . In our specific case,
    we are going to set it to d,
    If you want to have a header in your list view, you only need to add the attribute data-role="list-divider" and role="heading" 
    to the first li.
    The next step is to define te content of each li.Since we are going to have links to the nested pages,let's add 
    a tags with the attribute data-transition , this will indicate how the transition between the pages are going to look
    like. On the href we are going to set it to the id of the nested pages. Finally , the content of the page is going to 
    be anything , i.e : Page1,Page2,etc..
   
    We now have the skeleton of the main page, but we need to define the nested  pages.
    
Nested Pages
    By now, you should have learned that in order to define a page, we only need to create a div with data-role=page  and 
    set the id 
    In our case, we define another div ,added the data-role attribute and set it to page,then we set the id attribute.
   
    Be aware that in order to navigate from a link in the main page to a nested page, the href has to be the same as the
    id of the nested page.
   
    If you want to navigate back from the nested page to the main page, add another div with the data-role="content" 
    inside the nested page and add a "a" tag inside it with the data-role attribute set to button data-transition set to fade 
    and href set to the id of the main page.

    you can look at the following jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/nvega/DdzuT/4/
 

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
