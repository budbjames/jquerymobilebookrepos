#.# Creating, Customizing, and Overriding Inset Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You may want a list to appear contained in a page or form and adjust it's styling.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
    <li>Moe</li>
    <li>Curly</li>
    <li>Larry</li>
</ul>

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
////
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.

Add the data-inset="true" attribute to any list to make it an inset list.  Inset lists have the same abilities of normal list views.  The customizations can be any of the following:

Read only
Search filter bar - Add 'data-filter="true"'
Divided data
