5.1 Building a Basic List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
How can you display information in your application in a way that both looks good on mobile devices and is easy for your users to understand and use?

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
jQuery Mobile makes it easy to display your information in a mobile-friendly list view.

.Basic List
You can easily transform a standard HTML unordered list into a mobile-friendly list simply by adding `data-role="listview"` attribute to an unordered list element (`<ul>`). jQuery Mobile will add the styling, as well as a small arrow icon on the right side of the element to signify that it is a link. When an item in the list is tapped on, the framework will trigger a click event on the first link inside that list item, issue an AJAX request for the URL in the link, create the new page in the DOM, and then start a page transition while directing you to the new page.

<ul data-role="listview">
  <li><a href="band.html">Ben Folds Five</a></li>
  <li><a href="band.html">Cake</a></li>
  <li><a href="band.html">Gomez</a></li>
  <li><a href="band.html">Guster</a></li>
</ul>

.Numbered List
Sometimes you might want your lists to present items that should be in sequence. By simply changing your unordered list element (`<ul>`) to an ordered list element (`<ol>`), jQuery Mobile will add numbers to your list items.

<ol data-role="listview">
  <li><a href="band.html">Ben Folds Five</a></li>
  <li><a href="band.html">Cake</a></li>
  <li><a href="band.html">Gomez</a></li>
  <li><a href="band.html">Guster</a></li>
</ol>

.Read-Only List
You might not always want your lists to be interactive, rather just display your data. If you omit the link in the list item content, your list will still be styled by jQuery Mobile, but remain read-only.

<ul data-role="listview">
  <li>Ben Folds Five</li>
  <li>Cake</li>
  <li>Gomez</li>
  <li>Guster</li>
