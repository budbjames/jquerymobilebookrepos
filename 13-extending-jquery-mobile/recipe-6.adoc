13.6 Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
jQuery Mobile is very robust already but is it possible to extend jQuery Mobile further with plugins. 

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The jQuery library became very popular because of it's extensibility and plugin ecosystem.  jQuery Mobile also has a plugin ecosystem and is also extensible. 



Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
