4.6 Animated Page Transitions 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem

Most native applications on mobile devices use fancy transitions between pages to improve their user experience. We need to replicate those transitions to make our experience seem more native.

Solution

JQuery Mobile provides a great collection of page transitions out of the box. You can even easily write your own.e.

JQuery Mobile allows you to add a data-transition attribute to any of your links. The value of the attribute can be "slide", "slideup", "slidedown", "pop", "fade" or "flip". We will create a page that will allow us to sample all of the default jQuery Mobile transitions.

Our code for the list page will look like this:

----
include::recipe-6-code/example.html[]
----

We will also create a subpage with a back button. Since the back button has a data-rel="back" attribute, it will do the transition that the list page used in reverse when you click on it.

----
include::recipe-6-code/subpage.html[]
----

All of the transitions can also be run in reverse by adding data-direction="reverse" to the link.
