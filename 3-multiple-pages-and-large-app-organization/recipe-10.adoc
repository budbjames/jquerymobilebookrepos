3.10 Data-binding with Knockout.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
When developing forms with user input, you typically have to write code to sync the data entered by the user with the underlying data model.  If changes are made to your data model programmatically, you must check for these changes and reflect them on the client side for the user.
