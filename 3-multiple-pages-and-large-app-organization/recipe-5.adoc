3.5 Using Knockout.js on Multipage Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Problem
+++++++
Knockout.js is a Javascript data-binding library. 
It implements the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and is
particularly suited for dealing with single page applications (SPA).
In this recipe we'll show how to use Knockout.js in a jQuery Mobile multipage document application.


Solution
++++++++
Load all pages of the multipage document and process them with jQuery Mobile's progressive enhancement technique.
Define a main page in the multipage document and make sure that it is shown at the end of the page loading process no matter
what hash parameter is provided in the URL. The main page will be the entry point of the application. 

After all pages are enhanced, apply the the Knockout.js data-bindings on the entire DOM.
The ViewModel represents the state of the application. Only use declarative bindings to communicate state changes
between viewmodel and view. 
Knockout.js custom bindings are needed to update the appearance of complex jQuery Mobile compoments such as listviews 
after state changes.

Page Loading

Multipage documents are a special feature of jQuery Mobile. A multipage document 
consists of multiple pages within the same HTML file. A page is represented as
a div tag with the data-role="page" attribute set. When a multipage document is loaded,
only one of the multiple pages is enhanced by jQuery Mobile. Generally the first
page found in the documemt gets enhanced. 
But jQuery Mobile also incorporates the page hash parameter of a requested URL, 
so it is possible to navigate to and enhance any selected page in a multipage document.

In order to make multipage documents play nicely with Knockout.js, 
we need to implement a page loading mechanism that does the following:

- enhance all pages of the multipage document
- always navigate to a defined main page that acts as the entry point of the application
- use the generated DOM as a base for the Knockout.js data-binding.


Bindings

Custom bindings extend the built-in Knockout.js bindings. 
In our example, we use the jqmListview custom binding to automatically 
call listview("refresh") on listviews when items are added to or removed from the underlying array.
You might also consider using the Knockout.js "afterRender" callback to update jQuery Mobile components.

Please note that parts of the viewmodel can be bound to multiple representations in the view.
There are two listviews for hobbies (one in the personPage, the other in personDialog)
that are updated simultaneously on change.


Viewmodel

It is important to keep the viewmodel clean. Depencendies to the view itself or to other view related 
javascript libraries should be avoided. As a rule of thumb, the viewmodel must be testable without the browser. 
Unfortunately, the personDetails and personDialog actions in the viewmodel utilizes jQuery Mobile's changePage 
function to navigate within the multipage document. To minimize dependency problems, we pass the changePage function
as a parameter to the viewmodel. Our little example application has no need to keep track of the current page,
so we don't represent it in the viewmodel. The only thing the viewmodel stores except of the people's data
is the currently selected person. This is a common pattern in MVVM.
