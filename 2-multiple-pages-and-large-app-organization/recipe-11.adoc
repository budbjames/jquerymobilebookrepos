2.11 Using Knockout.js on Multipage Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Problem
+++++++
You want to use the JavaScript data-binding library Knockout.js in a jQuery Mobile multipage document application.


Solution
++++++++
Knockout.js implements the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and is particularly well suited for dealing with single page applications (SPA). To use it with jQuery Mobile multipage applications, first load all pages of the multipage document and process them with jQuery Mobile's progressive enhancement technique.

Then define a main page in the multipage document and make sure that it is shown at the end of the page loading process regardless of what hash parameter is provided in the URL. The main page will be the entry point of the application. 

After all pages are enhanced, apply the Knockout.js data-bindings on the entire DOM.

The viewmodel represents the state of the application. Only use declarative bindings to communicate state changes between viewmodel and view.

Knockout.js custom bindings are needed to update the appearance of complex jQuery Mobile components such as listviews 
after state changes.

Page Loading

Multipage documents are a special feature of jQuery Mobile. A multipage document consists of multiple pages within the same HTML file. A page is represented as a div tag with the data-role="page" attribute set. When a multipage document is loaded, only one of the multiple pages is enhanced by jQuery Mobile. Generally the first page found in the documemt is enhanced. But jQuery Mobile also incorporates the page hash parameter of a requested URL, so it is possible to navigate to and enhance any selected page in a multipage document.

To make multipage documents play nicely with Knockout.js, we need to implement a page loading mechanism that does the following:

- enhances all pages of the multipage document
- always navigates to a defined main page that acts as the entry point of the application
- uses the generated DOM as a base for the Knockout.js data-binding


Bindings

Custom bindings extend the built-in Knockout.js bindings. In our example, we use the jqmListview custom binding to automatically call listview("refresh") on listviews when items are added to or removed from the underlying array. You might also consider using the Knockout.js "afterRender" callback to update jQuery Mobile components.

Please note that parts of the viewmodel can be bound to multiple representations in the view. There are two listviews for hobbies (one in the personPage, the other in personDialog) that are updated simultaneously on change.


Viewmodel

It is important to keep the viewmodel clean. Dependencies to the view itself or to other view-related JavaScript libraries should be avoided. As a rule of thumb, the viewmodel must be testable without the browser. Unfortunately, the personDetails and personDialog actions in the viewmodel utilizes jQuery Mobile's changePage function to navigate within the multipage document. To minimize dependency problems, we pass the changePage function as a parameter to the viewmodel. Our little example application has no need to keep track of the current page, so we don't represent it in the viewmodel. Except for the user's data, the only thing the viewmodel stores is the currently selected person. This is a common pattern in MVVM.
