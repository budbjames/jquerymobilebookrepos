3.2 The Client-Side/Server-Side Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Websites used to present static content only and web servers used to deliver pure HTML files. The world is changing though and all of us expect dynamic content. Servers can be responsible for storage, creation and preparation of data for presentation. But why servers should be responsible? When should this job be shared between web servers and web browsers?

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Describe the solution to your recipe here.  It should be one to two paragraphs long.  It may include a code sample.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
