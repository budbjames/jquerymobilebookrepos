2.8 Structuring client side code (inc AMD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Out of the box, jQuery Mobile doesn't force you to use any sort of convention to organize your code. We need a way to keep our code clean and modular.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Using well-defined conventions and an AMD loader, we can make our scripts modular and easy to maintain.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Asynchronous Module Definition, or AMD, is a standard for loading multiple files asynchronously using JavaScript. There are several AMD libraries to chose from, but for the sake of simplicity, we will be using RequireJS, which is by far the most widely used AMD library.

The structure we use to organize our files is often determined by what MV* framework we will be using, if any. For this exercise, we'll make a bare-bones application without using a framework. However, these concepts can easily be applied to whatever framework or file structure we use.

A typical project would look something like this:

For the sake of our example, we will load all of our third-party libraries from remote content distribution networks, but any third-party libraries would typically go in the vendor directory.

Now, to create our index.html page.  The script tag at the bottom of the page will load the script passed in through the "data-main" attribute automatically, so everything will be initialized in main.js.

----
include::recipe-8-code/index.html[]
----

The main purposes of main.js will be to set up the RequireJS configuration, initialize the router and override a few jQuery Mobile defaults. The two main functions that RequireJS provide for us are require() and define(). The define() function is used to define a module or array of modules. The require() function is used to require modules that have already been defined but are needed again.

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/main.js[]
----

Now for the router. Most frameworks will give you a router to work with, but since we aren't using a framework for this example, we will override every click event with our own custom routing.

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/routes/router.js[]
----

For our example, we are only using one view for the entire application. It will render a basic list based on the data passed in from our models.

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/views/listview.js[]
----

Last of all, we will need to create our models. Our models are just going to serve up some static data. If you are working with a framework, your models will probably be significantly more robust.

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/models/main.js[]
----

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/models/fruit.js[]
----

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/models/meat.js[]
----

----
include::recipe-8-code/scripts/models/vegetables.js[]
----

That's all there is to it. Using RequireJS or a similar AMD loader, we can make our jQuery Mobile code completely modular and maintainable.
