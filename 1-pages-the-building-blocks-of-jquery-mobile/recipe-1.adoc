1.1 Page Anatomy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You need to set up a jQuery Mobile page with a page header, a page content area and page footer.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pages are the fundamental building block of jQuery Mobile apps. jQuery Mobile offers a convenient structure that can be used to quickly build pages, though it does not require a specific structure.

In jQuery Mobile, pages are placed inside of the <body> element of the main document. You can include different components by using the data-role attribute. Here's the code to create a simple page with a basic header, content area and footer:

.A Simple jQuery Mobile Page
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
	<title>My Page</title> 
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> 
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/jquery.mobile.min.css">
	<script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="/js/jquery.mobile.min.js"></script>
</head> 
<body>
	<div data-role="page">
		<div data-role="header">
			<h3>Title</h3>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			Page content goes here
		</div>
		<div data-role="footer">
			<h3>Footer</h3>
		</div>
	</div>
</body>

In the example page, you have a header, content area and footer, which are standard jQuery Mobile components that make up a page. As mentioned, you can put anything you like inside of a page, though the standard header, content and footer sections have many nice built-in features that make it easier to incorporate common mobile features such as navigation bars or back buttons.
