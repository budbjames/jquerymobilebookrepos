*author:* <a href="mailto:coloma@westminster.ac.uk">Anne-Gaelle Colom</a>

*Problem:* You want to create multiple pages that will look similar, and it seems inefficient to repeat the same code. You also want to link all those pages one after the other.

For example, you want to develop a page for each of your contacts where you can just click a button to send them an email, call them or send them an iMessage. You also want to be able to navigate through all those pages, as shown <<FIG2-19-1>>

*Description:* This recipe will cover how XSLT can be used to transform an XML file to linked jQuery Mobile pages. The example used will turn "objects" described in XML into jQuery Mobile pages (one per described "object"). The recipe will also show how to generate "back" and "next" buttons in the header of each page, to automatically link it to the previous and the next pages.
