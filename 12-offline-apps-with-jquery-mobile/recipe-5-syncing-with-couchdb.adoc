#.# Syncing With couchDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To use a web app offline typically requires a javascript object model to be saved on the client. Since you wouldn't be getting a current JSON from the server, any changes you make run the risk of getting your models out of sync.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CouchDB handles the complexity of keeping the server and client in sync. It not only works off of timestamps but can actually handle conflict resolution as well.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For starters you should install couchDB.  An easy way to install it with all the dependencies is to use homebrew.
  http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew

At the terminal install couchDB
  brew install couchdb

and then to start it
  couchdb

To verify that it's working:
  curl http://127.0.0.1:5984/

or you can view it in the browser:
  http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/index.html

For our example however, we will need a remote server in order to be able to disconnect the client from the server.
