#.# Syncing With couchDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To use a web app offline typically requires a javascript object model to be saved on the client. Since you wouldn't be getting a current object model from the server, any changes you make run the risk of getting your models out of sync.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CouchDB handles the complexity of keeping the server and client in sync. It not only works off of timestamps but can actually handle conflict resolution as well.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary discussion place and should be where code examples are put.  It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
