In order to have a useful offline application, you need to be able to determine at any point whether a user is offline or online.


Solution

Modern browsers provide several methods to determine a user's connection status.  
* navigator.onLine property -- true/false value
* online event -- fires when browser switches from an offline state to an online state.
* offline event -- fires when browser switches from an online state to an offline state.

Additionally, connection status may be further ascertained by listening for error events on ajax calls.

Discussion
