12.3 Detecting connection status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to have a useful offline application, you need to be able to determine at any point whether a user is offline or online.


Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Modern browsers provide several methods to determine a user's connection status.  
* navigator.onLine property -- The HTML5 spec says that this property "Returns false if the user agent is definitely offline (disconnected from the network). Returns true if the user agent might be online."
* online event -- This event fires when the browser switches from an offline state to an online state.
* offline event -- This event fires when the browser switches from an online state to an offline state.

Additionally, connection status may be further ascertained in the success and error callbacks on ajax calls.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
navigator.onLine may not always be accurate but its somewhat useful.   Think of it as a first line of defense.  Its useful to establish a baseline, but there may be instances where navigator.onLine == true, but actual network connectivity isn't available.  In order to handle inconsistency with this property we can track our own connection status.
[source, javascript]
----
//Initialize connection status to navigator.onLine property.
var onlineStatus = navigator.onLine;

function setOnlineStatus( aStatus ) {
    onlineStatus = aStatus;
}

function getOnlineStatus() {
    return onlineStatus;
}
----

How are online/offline events useful?  For example, when a user goes from an offline state to an online state, you may want to persist offline data to the server: 
[source, javascript]
----
$( window ).bind( "online", function( event ) {
    //Persist offline data to the server
});
----

Additionally when a user goes offline you may want to circumvent page loading errors:
[source, javascript]
----
$( window ).bind( "offline", function( event ) {
    setOnlineStatus( false );
});

$( document ).bind( "pagebeforeload", function( event, data ){
    if ( !getOnlineStatus() ) {
        //prevent default page load
	event.preventDefault();
	//perform alternative page load
        data.deferred.resolve( data.absUrl, data.options, page );
    }
});
----

Ajax calls let us know at a point in time the true state of a user's connection status to your server(s).  While a user's connection may be online its possible that for some reason your server(s) are not accessible.
----
$.ajax( {
    cache: false,
    dataType: "json",
    url: "/save",
    timeout: 500,
    type: "POST",
    data: {
        "foo": "bar"
    },
    error: function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
        //The ajax call failed, therefore the server is offline to us.
        setOnlineStatus( false );
    },
    success: function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {
        //The ajax call succeeded, therefore the server is online to us.
        setOnlineStatus( true );
    }
} );
