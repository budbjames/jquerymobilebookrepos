#.# Persisting and Syncing with Lawnchair.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Persisting data on a mobile device is straight forward if you're using localstorage. However, Jquery Mobile supports many devices that don't.

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
lawnchair.js supports supports some of the other ways to persist javascript objects. Not only does it add these other persistence options, but it abstracts them away to give you a single, simple interface. 

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next let's set up a basic implementation. 

  // code for basic implementation

This is using web storage. Now let's add an adapter for windows.
