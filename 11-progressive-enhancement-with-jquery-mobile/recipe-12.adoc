#.# Mobile device Orientation: Events and CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You want your application to respond to device orientation changes. 
From portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait. 

Solution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are two ways to deal with this -
1. binding to the 'orientationchange' javascript event, triggered when the orientation is changed.
2. applying an alternative style sheet. 

Binding to the orientationchange event on the window.

$(window).bind('orientationchange', function(e) {
    if (e.orientation === 'portrait') {
        // do portrait stuff
    } else if (e.orientation === 'landscape') {
        // do landscape stuff
    }
})

The orientationchange event is only triggered on the window. When the orientationchange event is not supported by
the browser (desktop browser for example), jQueryMobile falls back on the resize event and uses an aspect ratio
to determine landscape/portrait mode.

If you'd rather apply these styles via css, css media queries can be used to advantage. 

@media screen and (max-width: 320px) {
    /* portrait mode css rules */
    body {
        background: #ff0;
    }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 321px) {
    /* landscape mode css rules */
    body {
        background: #9fc;
    }
}

To keep the illustration simple, this is a very minimal example. You might need
to adjust the css media queries to make it work on your device. 

Describe the solution to your recipe here.  It should be one to two paragraphs long.  It may include a code sample.

Discussion
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The css media query based approach are preferable when all orientation based 


While both methods are equally valid, application needs may point you in one direction or another.

The javascript based method allows you to do data driven computations and adjust
the layout or some aspect of presentation in the app. One example might be recomputing
gutter margins in a photo-grid.

The discussion of your recipe should be where you break down
a description of the problem you are solving.  It is the primary
discussion place and should be where code examples are put.
It could be 4-6 paragraphs long.
